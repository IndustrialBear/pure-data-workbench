#X text 5 2 [lanparty] provides a quick way to create local area network
multiplayer patches. Start the server with `python lanparty.py` and
then wait for clients to connect. Sending things into the lanparty
object will send them to the server \, and with the default server
that will mean echoing those messages to all connected clients and
data from any client will be received at the outlet. All received data
will be prefixed with an ID. Modify the server to change that behaviour
to something more complex than 'echo'.;
