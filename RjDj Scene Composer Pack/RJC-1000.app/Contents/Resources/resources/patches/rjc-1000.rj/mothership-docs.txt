These messages that are currently supported by RJC-1000.master.pd. The help
file still is out of date. 

Master only has one inlet which is, where all messages must pass through! In
the client's _main.pd this inlet is connected to a receiver called
"#RJC1000-control". This is meant to be a target for messages coming from the
client app (similar to #touch etc.)

First it separates messages according to the first element (Pd expert note:
"list"-selectors are automatically trimmed.)

Possible first tags are: 

- "system": these are intended for tasks related to the whole system
- "modules": these are messages for single/all modules only.

The example messages in the following are all formatted to be sent to the
RJC-1000.master.pd inlet.

Possible "system" messages are: 

- page <num>
  Example: "system page 2" loads page 2

- loadconfig <filename>
  Example: "system loadconfig modules.txt"

- volume <num>
  Example: "system volume 0.6"

- clearslot <num>
  Example: "system clearslot 2": clears slot 2

- clearslots
  Example: "system clearslots": clears all slots

- slot <decor> <module>
  Example: "system slot 3 decor-s2m1-s2m1 eargasm.rjm/_module.pd" loads a
  module into slot 3

- timebase <...>
  This has an even deeper hierarchy and accepts "bpm", "sync", "pos", "tick",
  ... I think, currently only bpm is used. "bpm" info also is propagated to
  modules along with a "tick".

  Example: "system timebase bpm 120 4" sets quarter beat tempo to 120.

- pdgui 0/1
  Example: "system pdgui 0"
  This is used to inform the modules and the mothership about the necessity to
  show Pd's GUI widgets. For example _main.pd running on the iThing will send a 0 
  which can be used to [spigot] off anything that wouldn't be visible on the device anyway 
  to save CPU. 
  RJC1000-master automatically forwards the message to ALL modules as "pdgui <0/1>".

- vis <abstraction_name> <0/1>
  showing and hiding modules. "abstraction_name" is without ".pd".
    
- swipe <...>
  These go directly to the [rj_swipe] object inside the master patch. Useful
  to initialize [rj_swipe] with images etc.

"modules" messages: 

- "modules" messages are passed to the module specified by the first element,
  which can be "ALL" to reach all mods. They all go to the only message inlet
  of a module.

  Examples: 
  "modules SLOT-1 p0 0.9" - set "p0" of SLOT-1 module.
  "modules ALL vol 0.5"   - set "vol" of ALL modules.

The following module messages are part of the decorators so they are available
for all modules:

- rjc_volume <float>
  set volume from 0 ... 1, default is 0 in Pd.

- rjc_pan <float>
  set stereo pan from 0 ... 1, default is 0.5 in Pd.

- switch <float>
  switch dsp on (1) or off (0) default is 0 or off!
  Note: "modules switch" is gone. It has to be "modules SLOT-X switch" now.

Other module messages are specific to a module. This includes the
rjc_parameter* messages for parameters exposed to the RJC1000.
